2. How to Run the Script:
   - Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your computer.
   - Clone or download this project repository to your local machine.
   - Navigate to the project directory.

   - pandas
   - numpy
   - nltk
   - scikit-learn
   - matplotlib

4. Additional Information:
   - The 'datasets' folder contains the necessary data file ('movies.csv').
   - The 'movie_similarity.py' file contains the implementation of the movie similarity analysis.
   - The 'main.py' file is the entry point of the script.
